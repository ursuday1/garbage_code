become debt free
you cant acheive success in your comfort zone
if you dont have a dream you would give up to your struggle
instead of thinking what you dont want think of things you want
are you willing to pay the price to achieve your dream
you cant solve your problems if you use the same method again
comparing yourself doesnt helps you achieve your dreams
the ideas come in your mind is for you and you alone if you stop acting on your ideas then they will stop coming
